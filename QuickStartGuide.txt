Welcome, this is a very quick 'getting started' guide for C--

If you wish to check for updates run these following commands:
	-sh connectGIT.sh
	-sh update.sh
	-./cmm
	
If you wish to just run the program:
	-sh install.sh
	-./cmm
	NOTE: install.sh only needs to be run once, and does NOT need to be run if you updated

From inside the program you have 4 options:
	Option 1:
		Run an already created file. There will be a few examples in the /examples/ directory
	Option 2:
		Edit/create a file. THIS USES VIM.
	Option 3:
		View a file
	Option 4:
		Quit

Have fun.
